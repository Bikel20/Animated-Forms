# simple animated form, to demonstrate a little what I know how to do in js css
#1. the modal's box enters the screen smoothly, along with the loggin and button elements

#2. if it hears any empty fields, it will do a "shaking screen" motion 2x

#3. and if all conditions are met, the box that symbolizes our modal will disappear from the screen, in a downward movement
